# Illagers Love Armor

<Callout type="info">
The original Forge mod [can be found here.](https://modrinth.com/mod/illagers-wear-armor)
</Callout>

A Fabric port of the Illagers Wear Armor mod, where illagers have a chance of spawning with armor! Making them a little bit more difficult to defeat in a raid.

Illusioners, Evokers and Ravagers can also spawn with armor!

Pillagers will naturally spawn with armor, depending on the difficulty it could be diamond to chainmail.
