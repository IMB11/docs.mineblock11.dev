# Source Code

Most of my mods are open source, however there are a few which are not for various reasons.

Mods which are not open source are:

- [Terravista](https://modrinth.com/mod/terravista)
- [Would you shut up, man?](https://modrinth.com/mod/would-you-shut-up-man)

If you are trying to find a repo for a mod, [check my GitHub profile](https://github.com/mineblock11), or click the source link on the mod's Modrinth or Curseforge page.
